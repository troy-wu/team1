## Tech Stack

**Python:** The project is developed using the Python programming language, serving as the foundation for implementing various functionalities, including video capture, motion detection, and data manipulation.

**OpenCV:** This project utilizes OpenCV for video capture, motion detection, video frame processing. To detect movement and track objects, we calculate the phase difference between a base frame and a delta frame. We do this by applying image processing techniques such as contouring, dilation, and shadow removal to a threshold frame.

**Pandas:** This project utilizes the Pandas library for keeping track of motion events by recording timestamps.

**Flask and Flask-SocketIO**: Flask and Flask-SocketIO collectively allow the project to create a web-based user interface in python that provides real-time updates to the user, such as notifications about motion detection events and the current motion event count.

HTML/CSS: This project uses HTML/css to create a user friendly web interface to display movement data and an interactive wave which moves when a rep is complete.
